Minimum Requirements (Must-Have)
As part of the assignment, the student must:
1. Implement a utility or a web application that accepts a fragment of source code (as text
input or as a file).

1. The code may be written by the student or taken from an open repository.
2. ❗ The use of LLMs to generate the initial vulnerable code is strictly prohibited.
3. ❗ The analyzed code must not be compiled or executed — only static analysis

of the text is allowed.

2. Implement LLM-based code analysis, including:

1. identification of the vulnerability;
2. mapping to the corresponding CWE and OWASP Top 10 categories;
3. a textual explanation of the vulnerability and a possible exploitation scenario.

3. Implement the LLM-based remediation stage, including:

1. generation of a fixed version of the code or a patch/diff;
2. explanation of the applied changes.

4. Implement the re-check stage using LLM:

1. analysis of the fixed code;
2. confirmation that the vulnerability has been eliminated;
3. verification that no new issues have been introduced.

5. Generate a report that includes:

1. description of the original problem;
2. results of the LLM-based analysis;
3. the fixed code and explanation of the changes;
4. results of the re-check stage;
5. conclusions about the effectiveness and limitations of using LLMs.

Bonus
Bonus points may be awarded if:
1. a static analysis tool (e.g., Semgrep, Bandit) is integrated as a pre-check stage before the
LLM analysis;
2. the tool identifies and reports the exact lines of code where the vulnerability is located;
3. a risk level assessment is implemented (e.g., High / Medium / Low).
